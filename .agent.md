# Workspace notes

- For test purposes use the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable available to your host process
- Use DEFAULT_MODEL=moonshotai/kimi-k2:free
- Always use venv and the shims below venv/bin
- Always run tests (pytest, mypy) before commit and fix issues
- use venv `source venv/bin/activate` all the time to run python-related binaries and to install requirements.txt
